# Tic-tac-toe
This is a site aimed at allowing a user to play tic-tac-toe and track their wins, losses, and draws against a computer opponent. This will be useful for anyone wanting to play the game or practice and improve by tracking their progress.

## Features
- ### Game board
    - Displayed in the center of the page, the game board displays the current state of the game and allows the user to choose their move with a mouse click (or touchsreen tap) on the square of their choice.
    - This is intuitive and visually clear, allowing the user to understand the current state of the game.
    - The JavaScript displays the users move in the correct square, then decides and displays moves to respond.

    - This is updated by the JavaScript after every completed game.

- ### Reset Button
    - The Reset button allows the user to reset the board manually, allowing them to restart the current game if they choose to do so. This aids the user by letting them restart if they make a mistake.
